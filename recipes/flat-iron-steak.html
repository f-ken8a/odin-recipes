    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for a flat iron steak with a marinade. This marinade (made with olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper and mustard powder) ensures flavorful and juicy meat every time. It's best to marinate the steaks in the fridge for at least a few hours to reap the full benefits of the marinade.</p>
    <p>In short, one must marinate the steak in a resealable bag in the fridge for two to three hours then sear the marinated steak in a hot skillet on both sides until it reaches the desired level of doneness.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place steak in the hot skillet and discard any remaining marinade; sear and cook steak for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
        <li>Allow steak to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
